# Architecture-Encoded Communication in Microtubules
This repository contains all the necessary data to replicate the findings of the paper "Architecture-Encoded Mechanics and Communication in
Microtubules: A Multiscale Computational Perspective".

The input data to replicate the simulations are organized as follows:
- `md.mdp`: The mdp file used to run the simulations in GROMACS.

- `11PF/`: Folder regarding the 11-protofilament system.

  - `Input/`: Folder containing the pdb and tpr files.

  - `Topologies/`: Folder containing the topology defining the system.

- `13PF/`: Folder regarding the 13-protofilament system.

  - `Input/`: Folder containing the pdb and tpr files.

  - `Topologies/`: Folder containing the topology defining the system.

- `16PF/`: Folder regarding the 16-protofilament system.

  - `Input/`: Folder containing the pdb and tpr files.

  - `Topologies/`: Folder containing the topology defining the system.

- `Utils/`: Folder containing executables and scripts used to carry out the analyses
